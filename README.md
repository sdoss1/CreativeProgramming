_**Mask Project**_
 
This mask is a collage that presents a cross culture of the Batok tattoos of the Kalinga culture in the Philippines and corresponding tattoos that are significant and meaningful to me

Main Ideas:
Batok tattoos are a part of my family's culture and I am passionate about spreading it

I have been learning how to do tattoos recently for fun, I find this branch of art super interesting and exciting

The ideal tattoo I would get is one representative of the year of the snake, the year I was born and something I identify with in some ways. The center of the mask is built upon the Kalinga snake and my personal rendition

The mask is comprised of tattoos mapped out on the face
The face is divided into 4 areas: left cheek, right cheek, chin and forehead
The masks Kalinga and my tattoos mirror each other vertically

Here's some code of the mapping and projection of each tattoo on the face:

  let midwayBetweenEyes = scalePoint(face.annotations.midwayBetweenEyes[0]);
    image(snake2, midwayBetweenEyes.x-10, midwayBetweenEyes.y, 20,70)
    
  image(tribalsnake, midwayBetweenEyes.x-10, midwayBetweenEyes.y-80, 10,90)
